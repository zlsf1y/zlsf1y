    <p> What would a room be like if it breathed, if it could grow? I tried to imagine the possibility. </span> Would it be like a plant, able to feel pain and heal itself after injury? This room is made of plants, it is part of the courtyard, so I named the house 'the garden'.</p>

      <h2><a href="css-TheCrossroad.html"><font color=black>The Crossroad</font></a></h2>
      <p> Painful experience should be remembered, everyone may feel unforgettable after experiencing pain, I have to think about why it is unforgettable, how to remind people again and again. For me, what might bring back painful memories over and over again is the crossroads, so I took that as a title and I eventually took the subject to the personal.</p>

        <h2>A Shopping Magazine</h2>
        <p>  The main purpose of this work is to discuss issues related to consumerism, and to combine it with popular activities to choose camping culture. I think the reason why camping has gained popularity may be that the demand for going out has increased due to the pandemic, and camping has satisfied everyone's pursuit of a sense of ceremony. However, camping culture often comes with high consumption, and social media often promotes exquisite and ceremonial afternoon teas, but in reality, the cost of communicating the need for exposure to nature is not that high.</p>
