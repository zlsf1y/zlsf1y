                Painful experience should be remembered, everyone may feel unforgettable after experiencing pain, I have to think about why it is unforgettable, how to remind people again and again. For me, what might bring back painful memories over and over again is the crossroads, so I took that as a title and I eventually took the subject to the personal.

                The main purpose of this work is to discuss issues related to consumerism, and to combine it with popular activities to choose camping culture. I think the reason why camping has gained popularity may be that the demand for going out has increased due to the pandemic, and camping has satisfied everyone's pursuit of a sense of ceremony.
